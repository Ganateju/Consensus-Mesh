# 📡 Consensus Mesh: Verifiable Presence & Accountability

### **The Problem: The "Presence Gap"**
Traditional attendance systems—ranging from manual registers to QR codes and GPS—are fundamentally broken. QR codes are routinely photographed and shared via group chats, GPS coordinates are easily "mocked" using software, and manual signing is slow and inaccurate. This creates a **Presence Gap**, where students are marked "Present" while being physically elsewhere. This lack of accountability devalues the educational environment and creates administrative overhead.

### **The Solution: Environmental Consensus**
**Consensus Mesh** shifts the paradigm from "vulnerable digital proofs" to **"Physical Environmental Proofs."** Instead of a static code, the system utilizes the unique, invisible Radio Frequency (RF) landscape of the classroom. By creating a mathematical consensus between the Teacher's device and the Student's device, the system ensures that both parties are breathing the same air and seeing the same signals. It is not just an app; it is a **Zero-Trust Mesh of Evidence.**

## 🚀 Core Pillar Features

### 1. **Signal Bubble (Euclidean Shielding)**
The system defines a "Spherical Shield" around the teacher. Using N-Dimensional Euclidean math, it calculates the displacement between the teacher and each student. If a student is behind a concrete wall or in a different hallway, the **Wall-Guard™** logic detects the signal attenuation and automatically flags them as "Outside the Mesh."

### 2. **The "Pulse-Sync" Liveness Challenge**
To eliminate the possibility of one student carrying multiple phones for their friends, the system uses a **Synchronized Global Heartbeat**. At a trigger from the teacher, every phone in the room displays a cognitive challenge at the exact same millisecond. Students must find and tap the smallest number on their screen within a 3-second window. It is physically and cognitively impossible for one person to solve this on multiple devices simultaneously.

### 3. **Human Motion Audit (Inertial Sensing)**
Consensus Mesh uses the phone’s accelerometer to perform a **Human Audit**. By analyzing micro-tremors and motion variance, the system can differentiate between a phone held in a human hand and a "Ghost Device" sitting static in a backpack or being run via an emulator.

### 4. **Anti-Cluster Intelligence**
The mesh doesn't just look at individuals; it looks at the network. The system constantly cross-references every device in the room. If two devices report identical signal fingerprints and identical motion patterns, the system flags a **Proxy Cluster**, identifying exactly which roll numbers are attempting to share a single physical location.



### 5. **Teacher-Centric Calibration**
Teachers act as the **Anchor** of the mesh. The system provides real-time sliders allowing teachers to calibrate the "Bubble Radius" and "Similarity Sensitivity" based on the specific room environment—whether it is a small, high-interference lab or a massive, open-air auditorium.

### 6. **Master Scheduler & Secure Audit Logs**
The ecosystem is governed by a strict **IST (Indian Standard Time) Scheduler**. Attendance sessions can only be initialized if a class is officially scheduled in the MongoDB database. Every finalized session generates a cryptographically consistent log and a "Risk-Flagged" report for administrative review.

> **Note:** These are the primary pillars of the Consensus Mesh ecosystem; there are many more underlying security layers, cryptographic handshakes, and signal-processing features designed to ensure total classroom accountability.
